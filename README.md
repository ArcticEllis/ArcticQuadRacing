# ARCTICELLIS ArcticQuadRacing 

Description: 
This map adds a small racing track to the empty area near the pier best used for quad bike
racing. It is a small circut with a jump and can be used easily by upto 6 people at a
time. There is a small table where you can purchase ticket and spawn 'blazer' bikes from
(this will need your own code). This track can also be used for mini RC racing too.

## Installation

I try to make all my work easily installable to your servers so you should simply be able to:

> Drag and drop the ArcticQuadRacing into your resources
> Add ArcticQuadRacing to your server.cfg or extenal.cfg file
